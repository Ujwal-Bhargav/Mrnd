Hi all

Good that you started this! Hope you continue and learn how thinks work.
I suggest you to read "Lets C" book.
Also this is self-learning so if you share your code or give your code to your friend, you are not letting him/her to learn.
If you really care for them discuss how solve but dont tell them the solution let them figure it out. :)


IDE: Try installing VS code (or) CodeBlocks. (If you are facing any issues while installing IDE try googling them and find a way)book.

ALL THE BEST!! :) Hope you be honest to yourself.
