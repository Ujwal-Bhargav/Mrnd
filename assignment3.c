Question:
    There are N people P1,P2,P3,.....Pn having F1,F2,F3......Fn facebook friends, respectively.
    The solution to this problem is finding k=F(i)%F(j) such that maximum over all valid i,j.

Constraints:
    2<=N<=10^5
    1<=A(i)<=10^5

Input:
    First line contains an Integer N
    Second line contains N space seperated integers F1,F2,F3,,,,,,Fn.

Output:
    Print single line output which is k


Ex:
    Input:
        5
        1 2 3 4 5
